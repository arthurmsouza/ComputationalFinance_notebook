# Introduction

This repository contains my solution to Coursera course: Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics by Eric Zivot

I upload the code for my future reference only. Please do not plagiarize my work.

# File structure

This repository contains codes in 2 languages, one in R and one in Python.

The original implementation is done in R, and I translated R code files to Python notebooks for my future reference. Python notebooks also present the content in meaningful way compare to R code.
